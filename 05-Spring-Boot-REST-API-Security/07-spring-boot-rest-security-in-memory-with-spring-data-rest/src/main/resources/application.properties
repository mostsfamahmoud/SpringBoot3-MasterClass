# JDBC Properties
# ============================

# Configure the URL for connecting to the MySQL database.
# Format: jdbc:mysql://<HOST>:<PORT>/<DATABASE_NAME>
# In this case, it connects to a database named "employee_directory" hosted on localhost at port 3306.
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/employee_directory

# Set the username for the database user that will be used for authentication.

spring.datasource.password=springstudent

# ============================
# Spring Data REST Properties
# ============================

# Define a custom base path for all Spring Data REST endpoints.
# By default, REST endpoints are exposed at "/" (root path).
# This property changes the base path to "/api".
# Example: If you have an entity "Employee," the default endpoint would be "/employees".
# With this property set, the endpoint becomes "/api/employees".
spring.data.rest.base-path=/api

# Set the default number of items to return in paginated responses.
# If a client doesn't specify the page size, Spring Data REST will return 20 items by default.
# Pagination parameters can still override this, such as using "?page=1&size=10".
#spring.data.rest.default-page-size=20
