## About the Course
This course focuses on teaching Spring Boot 3 and Spring 6 with a hands-on approach. Every topic is reinforced with real-time projects to ensure a practical understanding of key concepts.

By following this course, I aim to:
1. Build real-world applications from scratch.
2. Gain proficiency in using Spring Boot for REST APIs, Spring MVC, Thymeleaf, and Hibernate.
3. Understand Spring Security for secure applications.
4. Implement advanced features such as AOP, custom validation, and database integrations.

## Key Concepts Covered

### Spring Boot 3
- Core functionality and annotations.
- Java-based configuration (no XML).
- REST API and MVC development.
- Hibernate/JPA integration for CRUD operations.
- Advanced features like Spring Boot Actuator and Dev Tools.
- Maven for project configuration and dependency management.

### Spring Framework 6
- Dependency Injection (DI) and Inversion of Control (IoC).
- Spring Beans, Component scanning, and Autowiring.
- Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) for cleaner code.

### Hibernate/JPA
- Object-to-Relational Mapping (ORM).
- CRUD operations and advanced mappings: One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-Many.

### Spring Security
- Role-based authentication and authorization.
- Secure login/logout functionality.
- Password encryption using bcrypt.

### Spring MVC and Thymeleaf
- MVC architecture and dynamic HTML content.
- Form validation and error handling.
- Full database CRUD integration with Thymeleaf templates.

### Advanced Topics
- Spring Data JPA and Spring Data REST.
- Automatic REST endpoint generation.
- Pagination and HATEOAS-compliant responses.
- AOP concepts like logging, pointcut expressions, and advice types.
